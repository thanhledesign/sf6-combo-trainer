# Character Thumbnails

This folder should contain the character thumbnail images:

- kenThumbnail.png
- terryThumbnail.png
- chunliThumbnail.png
- lukeThumbnail.png
- cammyThumbnail.png
- maiThumbnail.png
- ryuThumbnail.png

These images are approximately 200x200px PNG files showing character portraits.

If you don't have these files, you can:
1. Use placeholder images
2. Download official character art from Capcom
3. Screenshot from the game

The app will still work without them, but character cards won't show portraits.
